- **Field Validation**: Built-in utilities for validating form fields based on patterns.
- **TypeScript Support**: Strongly typed components and utilities for better development experience.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @oxidation-lab/oxy-form
```

## üé® Templates

The library provides a set of templates that can be used to render forms. You can easily switch between templates by specifying the template name in the configuration.

### BasicTemplate (Default)


The default template is a simple form layout with basic styling. It is suitable for most applications.

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { FormRenderer } from "@oxidation-lab/oxy-form";

const formConfig = {
  formName: "Multi-Category Radio Form",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "username",
      type: "text",
      label: "Username",
      required: true,
      placeholder: "Enter your username",
      validation: {
        minLength: 3,
        maxLength: 20,
      },
    },
    {
      name: "preferences",
      label: "Preferences",
      type: "radio",
      required: true,
      groups: [
        {
          name: "operatingSystem",
          options: ["Windows", "macOS", "Linux"],
          layout: "inline",
        },
        {
          name: "languageProficiency",
          options: ["Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"],
          layout: "newline",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  template: "BasicTemplate",
};


const App = () => (
  <div style={{ padding: "20px", marginTop: "300px" }}>
    <FormRenderer config={formConfig} />
  </div>
);

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
if (rootElement) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
  root.render(<App />);
}
```


## üîè Validation with Regular Expressions

You can easily integrate regular expression-based validation into your forms. The library supports a wide range of field types such as email, username, password, phone number, and more. Below is how you can use the validation patterns from the regexPatterns module:

### Import Regular Expressions

```jsx
import { regexPatterns } from '@oxidation-lab/oxy-form';
```

### Example: Email Validation

You can validate the email field using the predefined regular expression pattern.

```jsx
{
  name: "email",
  type: "email",
  label: "Email Address",
  required: true,
  validation: {
    pattern: regexPatterns.email, // Using regex for email validation
  },
}
```
### Example: Username Validation

The username field can have a minimum and maximum length and only allow alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

```jsx
{
  name: "username",
  type: "text",
  label: "Username",
  required: true,
  validation: {
    pattern: regexPatterns.username(3, 16), // Min 3, Max 16 characters
  },
}
```
